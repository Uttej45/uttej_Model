INDICATION   CONTROL  OVER   MOBILE   PHONES

In today’s vehicles, turn signals and hazard lights play a crucial role in 
helping drivers communicate their intentions to others on the road. Whether 
it’s signaling a turn or warning of a potential hazard, these indicators are vital for road safety. 
This project focuses on designing and building a microcontroller-based indicator system.
The system will be developed using C programming along with MATLAB Simulink,
and it will be tested on an Arduino-compatible development board to ensure proper functionality and performance.
